# Changelog Manager üìù

This [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension helps to build a changelog for your project, either in markdown or plain text files. The changelog format follows [Keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

For markdown files I suggest to enable `quickSuggestions` (disabled by default for markdown files):

```json
// Configure settings to be overridden for [markdown] language.
"[markdown]":  {
  "editor.quickSuggestions": false
}
```
